**Summary:** Pathogens compete for hosts as the result of specific immune memory. As a result, host-pathogen systems evolve under negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) from competitive interactions related to antigenic variation (the variation “seen” by the immune system).  I address coexistence and diversification of strains within pathogen populations for two systems with vast antigenic variation, for high-transmission malaria in humans and for viruses in microbes respectively. To address the role of NFDS, I consider the structure of diversity that emerges from the eco-evolutionary dynamics, by means of networks describing similarity,  ‘who interacts with whom’ and ‘who is protected from whom’.  Implications for pathogen persistence are discussed, to end if there is time with some speculation on the general role of NFDS in high diversity systems.

**Mercedes Pascual** is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, and an external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute. Dr. Pascual is a theoretical ecologist interested in the population dynamics of infectious diseases, their response to changing environments and their interplay with pathogen diversity. She is also interested in the structure and dynamics of large interaction networks in ecology and epidemiology. Dr. Pascual received her Ph.D. degree from the joint program of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  She was awarded a U.S. Department of Energy Alexander Hollaender Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship for studies at Princeton University, and a Centennial Fellowship in the area of Global and Complex Systems by the James S. McDonnell Foundation for her research at the University of Michigan.  She received the Robert H. MacArthur award from the Ecological Society of America. She is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
