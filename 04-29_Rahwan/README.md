**Summary:** Machine intelligence plays a growing role in our lives. How do we ensure that these machines will be trustworthy? This talk explores various psychological, social, cultural and political factors that shape our trust in machines. It will also propose an interdisciplinary agenda for understanding and improving our human-machine ecology.
