**Summary:** Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines. These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction engines — scientists and inventors — who continuously alter the landscape of discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to
substitute for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective advance. Here we show
that incorporating the distribution of human expertise into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable energy-relevant materials
increases the precision of materials predictions by ~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new
diseases increases precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical trials by
260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the scientists who will make them. By
tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it generates scientifically promising “alien” hypotheses unlikely to
be imagined or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating scientific advance. By
identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also suggest opportunities to improve
human prediction by reformulating science education for discovery.

**James Evans** is the Director of the Knowledge Lab, which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. James also founded and now directs on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsors an associated Computational Social Science workshop. James teaches courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, James received his doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University.
