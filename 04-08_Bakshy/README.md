**Summary:** Most randomized experiments consider a limited number of treatments in an effort to obtain statistical power with respect to some particular hypothesis.  However, in many problem domains, there may be dozens or even an infinite number of possible treatments that a researcher or practitioner may wish to consider.  Such problems naturally arise in optimization problems, such as increasing recruitment or participation into a program, or understanding the effects of one or more continuous treatment (such as the intensity of a stimuli).  Drawing on applied work at Facebook, I will discuss approaches to efficient experimentation techniques including multi-armed bandit optimization, Bayesian optimization, and personalized policy search.

**Eytan Bakshy** is a research director and scientist at Facebook, where he leads the Adaptive Experimentation team.  Eytanâ€™s work focuses on developing robust, general-purpose methods for decision making under uncertainty, and applying these methods broadly across Facebook and sister companies.  His interests include reinforcement learning, causal inference, Bayesian optimization, and Bayesian machine learning.  Eytan holds a Ph.D. in Information from the University of Michigan, and a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.
