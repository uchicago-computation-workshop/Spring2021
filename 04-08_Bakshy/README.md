**Summary:** Most randomized experiments consider a limited number of treatments in an effort to obtain statistical power with respect to some particular hypothesis.  However, in many problem domains, there may be dozens or even an infinite number of possible treatments that a researcher or practitioner may wish to consider.  Such problems naturally arise in optimization problems, such as increasing recruitment or participation into a program, or understanding the effects of one or more continuous treatment (such as the intensity of a stimuli).  Drawing on applied work at Facebook, I will discuss approaches to efficient experimentation techniques including multi-armed bandit optimization, Bayesian optimization, and personalized policy search.

**Eytan Bakshy** is the principal scientist and director on the Facebook Core Data Science Team, where he leads the Adaptive Experimentation group. Eytan is particularly interested in developing practical and robust methods for sequential experimentation and reinforcement learning for real-world applications. Much of Eytan's work has been motivated by the use of randomized experiments for understanding social behavior, including influence and information diffusion in networks.
