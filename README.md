## Checking Your GitHub Participation (For MACSS Students) 

To check your GitHub participation record, you may either

1. run "python MyGithubParticipation.py [your GitHub username] [your password]" (without the brackets) OR

2. edit MyGithubParticipation.py, put your GitHub access token inside the quotation marks on line 33 and run "python MyGithubParticipation.py [your GitHub username]" 

as a Unix command. 

Please note that GitHub will disable password authentication on Nov 13, and presumably option 1 will stop working after the date (see https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/). For information about how to obtain a GitHub access token, visit https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token.
