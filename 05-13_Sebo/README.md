**Summary:**  This work explores the development of robots that improve the performance of human-robot teams by shaping team dynamics to promote inclusion and psychological safety. The first half of the talk will discuss two strategies to improve the inclusion of the human members of a human-robot team: 1) a specialized role to interact with the robot and 2) supportive utterances from the robot. The second half of the talk will focus on how human expression of backchannels (e.g., "mm hmm", "yeah") correlate with team social dynamics (inclusion, psychological safety) and how robot backchannels influence the human-robot team.

**Sarah Sebo** is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago. Her research explores social dynamics in human-robot interactions, where a robot's social behaviors lead to positive outcomes for people. Dr. Sebo completed her Ph.D. at Yale University where she worked with Dr. Brian Scassellati in the Social Robotics Lab and her B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. .
