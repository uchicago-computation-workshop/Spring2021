**Summary:** In this talk, I will discuss older work looking at left-digit bias in the car market followed by ongoing work looking at left-digit bias with Lyft. We will explore why this bias is so prevalent and why many large companies fail to incorporate this bias into their pricing strategy.

**Devin Pope** studies a variety of topics at the intersection of economics and psychology. He has published work in top economics outlets such as the American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of Political Economy, and Review of Economic Studies. He has also published in psychology and multidisciplinary outlets such as Management Science and Psychological Science. Using primarily observational data, Pope studies how psychological biases play out in field settings and economic markets. Examples include left-digit bias and projection bias in car markets and time inconsistency in housing markets. Prior to joining the Chicago Booth faculty in 2010, Pope was on the faculty at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned a PhD in economics from UC Berkeley in 2007 and a BA in economics from Brigham Young University in 2002.
